We're in the process of documenting every operation provided by Bmg in depth, but only a subset has been finished so far. In the meantime, you can consult <u>[the complete list of operations](https://github.com/enspirit/bmg?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-operators)</u> in the README.

## Suppliers and Parts

Some examples for the individual operations available in Bmg use a version of the well-known [Suppliers and Parts database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppliers_and_Parts_database). It contains the following four relations:

##### cities
| city     | country |
|----------|---------|
| London   | England |
| Paris    | France  |
| Athens   | Greece  |
| Brussels | Belgium |

##### parts
| pid | name  | color | weight | city   |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| P1  | Nut   | Red   | 12.0   | London |
| P2  | Bolt  | Green | 17.0   | Paris  |
| P3  | Screw | Blue  | 17.0   | Oslo   |
| P4  | Screw | Red   | 14.0   | London |
| P5  | Cam   | Blue  | 12.0   | Paris  |
| P6  | Cog   | Red   | 19.0   | London |

##### suppliers
| sid | name  | status | city   |
|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| S1  | Smith | 20     | London |
| S2  | Jones | 10     | Paris  |
| S3  | Blake | 30     | Paris  |
| S4  | Clark | 20     | London |
| S5  | Adams | 30     | Athens |

##### supplies
| sid | pid | qty |
|-----|-----|-----|
| S1  | P1  | 300 |
| S1  | P2  | 200 |
| S1  | P3  | 400 |
| S1  | P4  | 200 |
| S1  | P5  | 100 |
| S1  | P6  | 100 |
| S2  | P1  | 300 |
| S2  | P2  | 400 |
| S3  | P2  | 200 |
| S4  | P2  | 200 |
| S4  | P4  | 300 |
| S4  | P5  | 400 |

Here's are some examples to illustrate what the relations represent:

* Supplier S1 (Smith) supplies 6 different parts
* There are 2 types of screw, one which weighs 17.0 and the other 14.0 (grams, let's say)
* There are 2 suppliers in London, 2 in Paris, and 1 in Athens
* Supplier S4 (Clark) has 900 parts in stock, in total
* For the part P5 (Cam), there are 500 items in stock in total, accross all suppliers

Our examples assume the four relations are referenced by variables by the same names: `cities`, `parts`, etc.
