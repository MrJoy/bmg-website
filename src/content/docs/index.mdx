# List the total number of purchases, excluding samples,
# for each product in the cheeze category
purchases
  .restrict(Predicate.neq(:product_type, 'sample'))

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="A solid foundation">
	  Bmg stays faithful to the mathematical foundations of relational databases. Everything is a relation and operations can always be chained.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Works with any data">
	  Query, transform, and combine data from SQL databases, CSV files, spreadsheets, Redis and more.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Unlimited composability">
	  It's trivial to extract and compose operations on relations in Bmg. 
	</Card>
	<Card title="Fits in any project.">
	  You can use Bmg in any Ruby codebase, by itself or alongside ActiveRecord or any other database wrapper.	
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
