**Relational algebra** is the fundamental mathematical framework upon which all relational databases are built. These databases are accessed by means of various dialects of SQL, and have highly specialized code to execute SQL as efficiently as possible. They don't use relational algebra under the hood. Nevertheless, relational algebra is the mathematical underpinning of SQL.

There are two reasons why you might want to learn more about relational algebra:

1) To gain a deeper understanding of SQL-based databases and make better use of their features
1) To query and process data with Bmg, using the full power of relational algebra

We will first discuss briefly what exactly *algebra* and *relational* means in this context, before showing some non-trivial examples of Bmg in action.
