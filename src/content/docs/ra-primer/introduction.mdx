**Relational algebra** is a part of the relational model, a mathematical framework invented in the late 1960s, upon which all relational databases (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite) are built. However, both internally and externally, such databases deviate quite a bit from the relational model.

Internally, they don't adhere strictly to relational algebra for querying and optimization. Externally, they all use dialects of the SQL language, which lacks many of the qualities of relational algebra. Nevertheless, the enduring power and popularity of SQL databases mostly derive from their roots in relational algebra.

**Bmg** is an implementation of relational algebra in Ruby. It can be used to query and transform in-memory datasets, which can be very convenient but not a replacement for a proper database system. Bmg can also be used in conjunction an external SQL database, in which case Bmg functions as a convenient and very flexible interface to the underlying database.

There are thus two reasons why you might want to learn more about relational algebra:

1) To gain a deeper understanding of SQL-based databases and make better use of their features
1) To query and process data with Bmg, using the full power of relational algebra

We will first discuss briefly what exactly *algebra* and *relational* means in this context, before showing some non-trivial examples of Bmg in action.
