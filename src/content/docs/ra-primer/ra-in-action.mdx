In the previous section, we introduced the mathematical notation for some of the basic operations of relational algebra: Union (**∪**), Project (**π**), Cross product (**×**), and Restrict(**σ**).

In this section, we will go through a few slightly more advanced uses of relational algebra to get a feel for how it works. Rather than introducing more mathematical notation, we will start using Bmg for our examples.

:::note
Although we we use Bmg in this section and the next one, we are only interested in presenting the fundamentals of relational algebra. The code shown here does not represent best practices for using Bmg!

Furthermore, we only consider the basic form of relational algebra here, without extensions like aggregations or outer joins. Those are described in [Advanced features](TODO), [SQL Interface](TODO), and in the [Operations Reference](TODO).

## Preliminaries

In what follows, we will work out some queries for the following three relations: 

##### Actor

| name : String | birth_year : Integer |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Jennifer Jason Leigh | 1962 |
| Peter Sellers | 1925               |
| Robin Williams| 1949               |
| Shelley Duval | 1949               |

##### Role 

| actor_name : String | name : String | film_name : String |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Jennifer Jason Leigh | Lois Kaiser | Short Cuts |
| Jennifer Jason Leigh | Pauline Avery | In the Cut |
| Peter Sellers | Dr. Strangelove | Dr. Strangelove |
| Peter Sellers | Inspector Jacques Clouseau | The Pink Panther |
| Robin Williams | Henry Sagan | The Fisher King |
| Robin Williams | Popeye | Popeye |
| Shelley Duval | Olive Oyl | Popeye |
| Shelley Duval | Wendy Torrance| The Shining |

##### Film

| name : String | production_year : Integer | director : String |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Dr. Strangelove | 1964 | Stanley Kubrik |
| Fast Times at Ridgemont High | 1982 | Amy Heckerling |
| In the Cut | 2003 | Jane Campion |
| Popeye      | 1980 | Robert Altman |
| Short Cuts | 1993 | Robert Altman |
| The Fisher King | 1991 | Terry Gilliam |
| The Pink Panther | 1963 | Blake Edwards |
| The Shining | 1980 | Stanley Kubrik |

In the tables below, we won't repeat the domain of the attributes, ie `String`/`Integer`.

:::note[Remember]
A **relation** can be viewed as a **table**. The table contains any number of **rows**/**tuples**, and also has an associated **header** which describes the **attributes** of the tuples. A relation *can not* contain any duplicate tuples.
:::

In Bmg, we can create these relations directly:

```ruby
actors = Bmg::Relation.new([
  { name: "Jennifer Jason Leigh", birth_year: 1962 },
  { name: "Peter Sellers", birth_year: 1925 },
  # ...
])
```

We can also work with relations based on JSON, CSV, a Redis database, or a SQL database. But here we will stick to plain relations.

## Birth years of actors who worked with Stanley Kubrik?

Let's start with a simple (though contrived) task: find the **birth years** of actors who appeared in films directed by Stanley Kubrik. To do this, we first filter the `Film` relation to obtain a relation with only those rows where `director = "Stanley Kubrik"`:

```ruby
sk_films = films.restrict(director: "Stanley Kubrik")
```

| name | production_year | director |
| ---- | --------------- | -------- |
| Dr. Strangelove | 1964 | Stanley Kubrik |
| The Shining | 1980 | Stanley Kubrik |

Next, we pick the roles associated with these films. To do that, we must use another central operator: **Join**. If you have any experience at all working with SQL or relational databases, you will be familiar with joins, but it might be worth bracketing that experience, because learning about **Join** from the ground up could give you another perspective.

**Join** glues together tuples from two relations, just like **Cross product**, but also applies a condition on which tuples to include in the new relation, by matching attributes from the first relation with attributes on the second one. In this case, we want rows where the **name** attribute from `sk_films` equals the **film_name** attribute from `roles`:

```ruby
sk_roles = roles.join(sk_films, :film_name => :name)
```

| film_name | production_year | director | actor_name | name |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Dr. Strangelove | 1964 | Stanley Kubrik | Peter Sellers | Dr. Strangelove |
| The Shining | 1980 | Stanley Kubrik | Shelley Duval | Wendy Torrance |

The new header contains all the attributes from both relations, except that **name** from `films` and **film_name** from `role` have been merged. That makes sense, because what we have done is precisely to pick out those tuples where one equals the other.

The only attribute we need from this relation is `actor_name` so let's next perform a `project`:

```ruby
sk_roles2 = sk_roles.project([:actor_name])
```

| actor_name | 
| ---------- |
| Dr. Strangelove |
| Wendy Torrance |

And finally, we perform another **Join** to get the birth years:

```ruby
sk_roles2.join(actors, :actor_name => :name)
```

| actor_name | birth_year |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Peter Sellers | 1925 |
| Shelley Duval | 1949 |

## Join = Cross product + Restrict

Let's get even more clear about exactly how **Join** works. As we have seen, **Join** combines tuples from two relations, let's call them **R** and **S**, to form a new relation **T**, but only includes those pairs of tuples where the values of one or more attributes match up. In the simplest case ("natural join"), any tuples that have the same name are compared, and if their values are the same in both tuples, they are included in the output.

Consider these two relations:

| X1 | Y1 | Z |
| -- | -- | - |
| 1  | 2  | 3 |
| 5  | 6  | 7 |

| X2 | Y2 | Z  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 11 | 12 | 7  |
| 15 | 16 | 13 |

A **Natural join** produces:

| X1 | Y1 | Z  | X2 | Y2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 5  | 6  | 7  | 11 | 12 |

because exactly one pairing of tuples was found to have the same value in an attribute (`Z`) with the same name.

To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algebra, it helps to understand how joins can be built up from simpler operations (although that is not something you would normally ever do).

In essence, the idea is: **Cross product** + **Restrict** -- first do a **Cross product** to get **all** the combinations of tuples, then a **Restrict** to pick out the combinations that have matching attributes. However, since **Cross product** expects unique attributes, we first have to rename overlapping attributes. And as a last step, we remove the extra attributes created by the rename. Let's go through this step by step:

**1. Rename attributes**

We let the first relation be intact, and change `Z` in the second one to `Z2`, so it now has the header:

| X2 | Y2 | Z2 |
| -- | -- | -- |

**2. Get the cross product**

| X1 | Y1 | Z  | X2 | Y2 | Z2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | 2  | 3  | 11 | 12 | 7  |
| 1  | 2  | 3  | 15 | 16 | 13 |
| 5  | 6  | 7  | 11 | 12 | 7  |
| 5  | 6  | 7  | 15 | 16 | 13  |

**3. Restrict to keep only rows where `Z = Z2`**

| X1 | Y1 | Z  | X2 | Y2 | Z2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 5  | 6  | 7  | 11 | 12 | 7  |

**4. Project, to keep all attributes except `Z2`**

| X1 | Y1 | Z  | X2 | Y2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 5  | 6  | 7  | 11 | 12 |

And this is the exact same result as we would get with a **Join**.

In the case of our films and roles, the situation is slightly different: the attibute they share, `name`, is **not** the one we want to join on, because it means different things in the two relations. Instead, we want to match `film_name` from `role` with `name` from `films`. The solution follows the same steps. We rewrite:

```ruby
roles.join(sk_films, :film_name => :name)
```

as:

```ruby
sk_films2 = sk_films.rename(:name => :film_name2))  
roles.cross_product(sk_films2)
     .restrict(Predicate.eq(:film_name, :film_name2))
     .project([
       :film_name, :production_year,
       :director, :actor_name, :name
     ])
```

Again, the point here is to demystify the **Join** operation and get a clear sense of the algebraic way of combining operations. Just as **Join** can be defined by simpler operations, we can use Bmg to create our own composable building blocks for data querying and transformation.

## Actors who appeared in the same film

For our next exercise, let's find pairs of actors who appeared in the same film. Taking a quick look at the **Role** relation at the beginning of this section, we immediately see that there is only one film that appears twice (namely *Popeye*), so we expect only one pair of actors.

To get our answer, we need to join the **Role** relation with itself. To do that, we create a new relation that is exactly the same as **Role** but with `actor_name` renamed to `actor_name2`, because we need both names in our output relation. The last step is to project only `actor_name` and `actor_name2`.

```ruby
roles2 = roles.rename(:actor_name => :actor_name2)
roles2.join(roles, [:film_name])
      .project([:actor_name, :actor_name2])
```

| actor_name | actor_name2 |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Jennifer Jason Leigh | Jennifer Jason Leigh |
| Peter Sellers | Peter Sellers |
| Robin Williams | Robin Williams |
| Shelley Duval | Robin Williams |
| Robin Williams | Shelley Duval |
| Shelley Duval | Shelley Duval |

Hmm, that's not right. We are getting "pairs" where both actors are the same one. After all, every actor appeared in the same film as themselves (at least from the viewpoint of relational algebra). We need to further restrict this relation to only include tuples where `actor_name` and `actor_name2` are not the same.

```ruby ins={3}
roles2.join(roles, [:film_name])
      .project([:actor_name, :actor_name2])
      .restrict(Predicate.neq(:actor_name, :actor_name2))
```

| actor_name | actor_name2 |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Shelley Duval | Robin Williams |
| Robin Williams | Shelley Duval |

Still not right. We're getting the same pair twice, in opposite order. To make sure it's only included once, we change the condition that they are different to the stronger condition that the first one is *smaller than* the second. This works since there is a strict ordering between strings.

```ruby {4}; ins="lt"
roles2.join(roles, [:film_name])
      .project([:actor_name, :actor_name2])
      .restrict(Predicate.lt(:actor_name, :actor_name2))
```

| actor_name | actor_name2 |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Robin Williams | Shelley Duval |


## Who knows who?

1. Each Actor-Director pair (actor1, director1)
2. Add to each tuple other actors who worked with the same director (actor2) - can't be same as actor1
3. Add any director
