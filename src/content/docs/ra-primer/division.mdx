We will conclude this primer with a somewhat more advanced example of composing operations in Relational Algebra to construct a new operation. **Division** is one of the classical operations of Relational Algebra, but it hasn't been implemented in SQL and is relatively unknown. Nevertheless, once you know about it, it can come in handy in many situations.

The examples and equations in this section only work because relations have set semantics, meaning they can have no duplicate tuples.

What does it mean to divide one relation by another? It means the inverse of a Cross product, similar to how, in arithmetic, division is the inverse of multiplication. In other words, division is a way to "undo" multiplication, and multiplication is a way to "undo" division. If **X = Y * Z**, then **X / Y = Z** and **X / Z = Y**. It's the same thing with divison in Relational Algebra: if a relation **R1** is formed as the Cross product of **R2** and **R3**, then **R1 ÷ R2 = R3** and **R1 ÷ R3 = R2**.

## A First Approximation

Let's bring back the example of relations that describe the wearing of garments from the [section on relations](/ra-primer/relations). We start with the following two relations:

**R1**
| name | garment |
| ---- | ------- |
| Alice | t-shirt |
| Bernard | sweater |

**R2**
| color |
| ----- |
| yellow |
| red |

From these, we form the cross product **R3 = R1 x R2**:

**R3**
| name | garment | color |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Alice | t-shirt | yellow |
| Alice | t-shirt | red |
| Bernard | sweater | yellow |
| Bernard | sweater | red |

(Yes, we are now dealing with people wearing multiple sweaters or T-shirts.)

We can get **R1** by dividing **R3** by **R2**, and vice versa. In other words: **R3 ÷ R2 = R1**, and **R3 ÷ R1 = R2**.

Let's introduce a bit of terminology: In this example, **R3** is the *dividend* which we divide by a *divisor* to get a *quotient*. We may note a few things about the divisor and the quotient:

1. Both the divisor and the quotient can have one or more attributes in their heading
1. The headings of the divisor and quotient must each be a subset of the heading of the dividend, and they must not overlap
1. Thus, the heading of the quotient consists of exactly those attributes of the dividend that are not in the divisor
1. The tuples in the quotient are simply what you get if you project its attributes from the dividend

In this example, we could get the quotient of **R3 ÷ R1** by noticing that the quotient's heading has a single attribute (`color`), which we get by removing the attributes of **R1** from the heading of **R3**. Using Bmg, we can get the quotient like this: `r.project([:color])` and since tuples in a relation are unique, with no duplicates, this will yield exactly **R2** as shown above.

## Division with remainder

In reality, very few relations can be constructed as cross products. We want to define division so that it works for any relation. The key is this observation: a relation which is a perfect cross product is a special case. Any other relation can be formed by taking such a cross product and adding or removing some tuples.

Moreover, even if there is a divisor that divides a relation perfectly, most other divisors do not. This is analogous to integer division (where all three of dividend, divisor, and quotient are integers). For example, `12 / 2 = 6`, `12 / 4 = 3`, etc. But `12 / 5 = 2`, with a *remainder* of 2. If we reverse the operation (`5 * 2 = 10`), we do *not* get back the original dividend. In the same way, relational division may also yield a remainder of tuples that are in the dividend but not in the cross product of divisor and quotient.

A bit informally, we might describe the problem like this: *Construct a quotient which, when multiplied by the divisor, yields the largest result which is fully contained within the dividend.* In the integer example, `2` is the largest number which, when multiplied by `5` yields a result which is not bigger than `12`. (In this sense, `10` is "contained" in `12`.) Make sure you have internalized this intuitive definition before reading on!

Now, given a relation **R** and a divisor **D**, how do we find the quotient **Q** which is the largest relation so that the cross product **C = D x Q** is contained within **R** (meaning the tuples in **C** are a subset of those in **R**)? (We are not asking about the heading of **Q**, it is already known. *Largest* here means: having the most number of tuples.)

To illustrate this, let's modify the example above so that we start with this relation:

**R**
| name | color |
| ---- | ----- |
| Alice | yellow |
| Alice | red |
| Bernard | yellow |
| Mariam | blue |

(We have omitted the `garment` attribute, but the intended meaning is still that *a person with a particular name is wearing a particular color*.)

And this divisor:

**D**
| color |
| ----- |
| yellow |
| red |

We know the heading of **Q** is `(name)`, so we can start by simply projecting this from **R** to form an intermediate relation, **Q0**:

| name |
| ---- |
| Alice |
| Bernard |
| Mariam |

It's clear that **C0 = D x Q0** does not equal **R** because it contains tuples that are not in **R**, marked with *italics* below:

**C0**
| name | color |
| ---- | ----- |
| Alice | yellow |
| Alice | red |
| Bernard | yellow |
| *Bernard* | *red* |
| *Mariam* | *yellow* |
| *Mariam* | *red* |

**C0** has three tuples that are not in **R** and thus, **C0** is not "contained" in **R**. To get the actual quotient, we want to remove from **Q0** those tuples which cause **C0** to become "too large", namely `(Bernard)` and `(Mariam)`.

Remember, in a relation produced by a cross join between two relations, every tuple from the first relation is paired with every tuple in the second relation. Here, we are looking for those tuples in **Q0** for which **R** does not have all the pairings that occur in **C0**. To do that, we remove from **C0** all tuples from **R**.

**C1**
| name | color |
| ---- | ----- |
| Bernard | red |
| Mariam | yellow |
| Mariam | red |

Now we have a list of tuples that are "missing" in **R** compared to **C0** (which is the cause of **C0** being too large.) Notice that **Alice is not included in this list**!

To get the actual quotient, we now remove the names in **C1** from **Q0**:

**Q**
| name |
| ---- |
| Alice |

And that's it! We have formed the quotient of **R ÷ D**. Which question did we answer by doing that? The usual way to express it is:

> *Which tuples in **Q0** are paired (in **R**) with *all* tuples in **D**?*

A bit cryptic! Let's rephrase that in terms of our example:

> *Given a list of colors, which persons are wearing all the colors in the list?*

It is easy to see that Alice is indeed the only person wearing both yellow and red. As an exercise, you could go through the steps above with different color lists (for example `[yellow]`, or `[blue]`, or `[red, blue]`) to check that we get the intended results.

We can of course also ask the opposite question:

> *Given a list of people, which colors are worn by all people in the list?*

Hopefully, the usefulness of the division operation is starting to become apparent. Here are a few other examples of questions that can easily be expressed using relational division:

> *Which customers have bought every product from the deluxe line?*

> *Which recipes contain all specified ingredients?*

> *Which candidates have all of the required skills?*

> *Are there any team members who have worked on all of the listed sub-projects?*

## Division in Bmg

Let's wrap up the solution above in a reusable formula. To recap, given a relation **R** and a divisor **D**, we want to produce the quotient **Q**. We know the attributes of **Q** are those of **R** minus those from **D**. Let's call **Q**:s attribute set `qatt`. The steps to obtain **Q** are (with name assignments in paranthesis):

1. Project `qatt` from **R** (**Q0**)
1. Form the cross product of **D** and **Q0** (**C0**)
1. Subtract **R** from **C0** (**C1**)
1. Project `qatt` from **C1** (**Q1**)
1. Subtract **Q1** from **Q0** (**Q**)

Ignoring some of the details, we can summarize the process like this:

* Produce all possible tuple pairings
* Remove the pairings that we actually have, to get those that we don't have
* Knowing which pairings we don't have, remove corresponding tuples from the candidate quotient

Again, the resulting quotient is *the largest relation which, when cross joined with the divisor, yields a relation which is a subset of the original relation*.

Using Bmg, we can create a Ruby method that encapsulates the entire procedure:

```ruby
def divide(relation, divisor)
  qattr = relation.type.attrlist - divisor.type.attrlist

  q0 = relation.project(qattr)   # Candidates
  c0 = q0.cross_product(divisor) # All pairings
  c1 = c0.minus(relation)        # Pairings minus those we have
  q1 = c1.project(qattr)
  q0.minus(q1)                   # Remove candidates with missing pairings
end
```

Picking one of the examples given above, we can use `divide` like this:

```ruby
deluxe_products = products.restrict(category: :deluxe)
                          .project([:product_id])
customers_products = purchases.project([:customer_id, :product_id])
vip_customers = divide(customers_products, deluxe_products)
```

:::note
Bmg provides a `divide` operation with some extra optimizations, in particular when used with relations from a SQL database.

## Appendix: Division in SQL

As mentioned above, SQL databases do not provide the **Division** operator. There are several approaches to how to achieve relational division in SQL. Most commonly, they mimic the two `minus` operations with nested `EXCEPT` or `NOT EXISTS` clauses.

If you want to dive into the topic, these slides are very helpful: [On Making Relational Division Comprehensible](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~mccann/research/divpresentation.pdf)

This concise paper makes a case for a simple solution which is also typically more performant than usual double `NOT EXIST`: [A Simpler (and Better) SQL Approach to Relational Division](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1614&context=jise)

tl;dr Our final query above would be implemented with the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM customers_products
WHERE product_id IN ( SELECT product_id FROM deluxe_products )
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING COUNT(*) =
  ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM deluxe_products );
```
